    # Break apart `spec` task to allow parallel execution
    #  - `rake spec_prep` creates fixtures needed by all the tests.
    #  - `rake spec_clean` deletes those fixtures.
    #  - `rake spec_standalone` runs the actual test.
    #  - `rake spec` does all three.
    # So, if the setup and teardown steps are not separated out, there
    # are race conditions.
